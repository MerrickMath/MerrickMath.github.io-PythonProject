Welcome to the math 10 python project. In this project you will be learning how to make programs using python. This project will focus on the competencies problem solving, technology, and communication. The goal of the project is designing algorithms/programs/general solutions that could be used to complete each task. Some tasks are significantly more challenging than others. General solutions will be coded into programs via Python. For more information on python, check out the <a href="https://www.python.org"> Python Website </a>.
